# Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery CheatSheet. 

*“Understanding the complexity of an algorithm is the difference between a solution that works and a solution that scales.”*

> Based on the Udemy Course: JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises

## Project Purpose
This repository will serve as a technical laboratory for mastering **Computer Science** fundamentals. My goal is to bridge the gap between business strategy and technical excellence by implementing high-performance solutions.

Drawing from my experience as a **Solutions Engineer and Technical Leader**, I focus on writing code that is not just "functional," but optimized for scale, readability, and efficiency.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript / PHP / Python.
* **Testing:** Logic validation through LeetCode challenges.

---

## Repository Structure
The project is organized to show a progression from core theory to complex problem-solving:

* **`00-Foundations/`**: Deep dive into Big O Analysis, Classes, OOP, and Pointers.
* **`01-Data-Structures/`**: Implementation of Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, and Graphs.
* **`02-Algorithms/`**: Sorting, Search, Recursion, and Dynamic Programming.
* **`03-LeetCode-Challenges/`**: Practical application of concepts to real-world technical interview problems.

---

## Key Objectives
* **Performance Optimization**: Analyzing Big O to optimize system efficiency.
* **Scalable Thinking**: Designing data structures that handle high-complexity data delivery.
* **Technical Communication**: Documenting the "Why" behind the "How" for every technical solution.

---

## Practical Application
In my current professional role, I apply these concepts to:
* **ETL Pipelines**: Using efficient sorting and hash mapping to optimize data processing flows.
* **Operational Excellence**: Automating service flows that resulted in a **3x increase in SLA compliance**.
